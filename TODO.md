# DashBlocks TODO


## Options templates

Create class to manage standard props/options templates for various chart types. 
So instead of specifying all props in dashboard definition always, just refer to 
template name (like DbDygraphs-AreaLine)

Consider making template parameterized, i.e. pass axis name (see plotly props)

# Event propagation up to dashboard level 

- [X] db-event: generated by all widgets and propagated up to dashboard
- [X] augment db-event with widget id on widget level 
- [ ] Events for chartjs
- [ ] Events for plotly
